# Proficiencies

## Work Credit
This course is graded based on proficiencies.  Ideally, this will allow your final grade in the course to accurately reflect your proficiency in the subject matter _at the end of the semester._  This, however, will require some cooperation from you.

I am normally quite flexible about due dates, but with the large class size this semester, I am much more limited in my flexibility.  I still want to be fair though, and I want minimize the cost of short term failure as much as possible.  This semester, we will try something new.

Due dates are firm.  If you turn in your work on time, but you fail to pass off all of the proficiencies associated with it, I am willing to give you another chance.  You can revise your work, fix any errors, and turn it in again, to try to earn the proficiencies you missed.  I do expect you to be respectful of my time.  If I am not convinced your work represents your sincere best efforts, I reserve the right to refuse to give additional chances.  If you allow excessive time to pass before taking advantage of this opportunity, I may also choose to withdraw it.

If there are extenuating circumstances that make it excessively difficult to get your initial work in on time, please let me know _as soon as possible._  Keep in mind that it costs _me_ time when I grade late work, so if you believe a circumstance warrants an exception to my policy, be respectful of my time, and notify me as soon as you are aware of the situation, so I can minimize the cost to myself.

## Grading
There are two categories above.  Each subcategory is worth 10% of your grade.  The value of the subcategories in the Knowledge category is divided up between the bullets in each subcategory.  The Knowledge category proficiencies can be satisfied mostly through essay assignments.  The Application category proficiencies are mostly satisfied through projects.

There are a few proficiencies that are not obviously associated with any assignment.  It is up to you to decide how you want to demonstrate these.  You may find that some of the coding assignments have sufficient flexibility to sneak in an additional proficiency or two.  You might consider writing an additional essay to demonstrate some proficiencies.  You may find that you can work some into one or both of your projects.  You might even request some time (a week in advance, because you are so polite) during a work day to give a presentation.  Proficiencies that are not obviously covered by an existing assignment have no formal due date.  Obviously they must be turned in before the end of the semester, but please respect my time.  If _everyone_ waits till the end of the semester to turn in this work, I will not have time to grade it all before grades are due.  If this occurs, I will put grades in as they are, and ungraded work will not be counted toward your grade.  In short, if you want to guarantee that this work will be counted for credit, respect my time, and don't procrastinate.

You should also be aware: The tabletop and video game projects are 
_critial._  If you do not complete them according to the posted requirements, 
you _will_ fail this course, regardless of the grade calculated from your proficiencies.
