# Course Work
Assignments and projects will not be given letter grades.  Instead, they will be used to demonstrate proficiencies.  The final course grade will be calculated based on the proficiencies demonstrated.  See Proficiencies.md for more information on grading.


## Projects

### Progress Reports
A progress report should begin with a brief description of the game, if this has not been done in a previous report.  After that, it should reveal the current progress on the project.  Lastly it should include places where you have struggled, as well as your solutions.  If you are still struggling with something, this is also a good time to get feedback and suggestions from the rest of the class.  A progress report is generally shorter than 5 minutes.


### Tabletop Game
The tabletop game project represents your opportunity to prove that you understand and can apply the principles of basic game design.  The game should accommodate at least two players.  The average play time for one game should be 15 minutes or less.  You must be able to identify the core mechanic of your tabletop game, and you should have a printed copy of the rules that is clear and unambiguous.

Some kinds of tabletop games are not appropriate for this class, because they cannot provide sufficient demonstration of the proficiencies this project is intended to demonstrate.  These include "party" games, along the lines of Charades, Apples to Apples, and Pictionary.  While plenty of fun, these games lack the kind of solid mechanics that are necessary to video game design.  This also includes social games, like Mafia (and all of its variations), which have equally informal rules.

Tabletop projects should have well defined, unambiguous rules.  Metrics of success and failure should be well defined, and success should not rely on non-mental skills (drawing, acting, etc...).

This project will be graded in class.  Students will play test their games with other students in the class, while the professor or a TA will observe.  Games that take excessively long may not be able to be completed during the allotted time.  In this case, the game will only earn a grade appropriate for what was demonstrated during the time it was played.

This assignment generally demonstrates these application proficiencies: Demonstrate an understanding of basic game design, Leverage reward psychology to design games that are motivating.  If you implement it in a way that demostrates additional proficiencies, you must inform me and provide me with evidence to get credit for those.


### Video Game
The final project for this course is a video game.  This is your opportunity to show your ability to apply everything you have learned in this course.

The video game project must meet the following requirements:
- Be written in Python or C/C++
- Have some degree of animation
- Have some sound effects
- Have an element that is educational or which has a purpose greater than just entertainment (be more than just a toy)

Due to past difficulties, there are some additional limitations and guidelines for this project.  You may not use 3D rendering.  Unforunately, when I have allowed this in the past, the project was barely past the initial stages by the semester ended.  It is just too much to do in the alotted time.  Second, in the past I have been known to allow exceptions to the language requirements.  It is highly recommended to use Python, because it is fast to program in, and it has excellent game tools.  I allow C/C++, with a library like SDL or SDL2, because the prerequisite courses for the class teach it, and it offers better performance when necessary.  I will not make exceptions for Java or web.  In the past, students who used Java struggled to adequately complete their games on time.  It takes less time to learn Python and then use it for the project than it takes to use Java, even if you already know Java.  Web is a poor platform for games, because it is impossible to control timing adequately for quality scheduling.  Students who have developed for web in the past have also struggled to finish on time, because so much time was spent struggling to make things work as expected.

In short, Python is highly recommended, C/C++ is acceptable, no exceptions for Java or web, and if you can provide a compelling argument for an exception for another language, I will consider it.  Note that, "I don't have time to learn Python" is not a compelling argument, since it will save you more time that it takes to learn it.  Likewise, "I am already learning another language in another class" will not be accepted either, because learning multiple things (including languages) at the  same time is very common in industry, so it is time to get used to it.

This project will be graded in class.  Students will present and demonstrate their games during the last two or three class periods of the semester.  The presentations will also include some reflection of challenges encounted during design and development as well as how those challenges were overcome.  The amount of time allotted for each game will depend on how many games need to be demonstrated as a consequence of how students choose to group up.

This assignment generally demonstrates these application proficiencies: Discover and learn to avoid common pitfalls in video game development, Make a video game that is more than just a toy.  If you implement it in a way that demostrates additional proficiencies, you must inform me and provide me with evidence to get credit for those.


## Assignments
### Answer Value of Games Questions
During the first week of class, you will watch a series of a videos that will broaden your perspective on games.  This assigment is your opportunity to write down some reflections on what you have learned.  In this assignment, you are asked to answer two questions.

What can games teach us?  Everyone already knows that games improve motor skills, hand eye coordination, and other things.  The question is not "What _do_ games teach us?" but rather "What _can_ games teach us?"  Do not quote things from the videos either.  This should be _your_ reflections, not a recitation of the content we watched in class.  What kind of things do _you_ think games can teach us, that perhaps no one else has thought of before?

What do we need games to teach us?  Again, this should not be things that games _already_ teach us.  It should also avoid things that have been tried before.  If you were to make a game, with the intent of expanding the scope of what games teach to improve the world, what do you think might be the most beneficial?  Perhaps consider the current state of our world.  What challenges are we facing?  How could video games be designed to help teach us to overcome these challenges?  Again, these should be _your_ reflections, not recitals of ideas from the videos or othe sources.

Lastly, please be specific.  Answers like, "We need video games to teach us to solve the challenges of the world," are not acceptable.  Choose two or three specific challenges, and list them.  If you desire, you may explain why these challenges are important, why we should use video games to teach us how to solve them, and how that might work.  This is not required, however, unless it is unclear why a challenge is important.  Please turn your answers in written or printed in class to get credit for this assignment.


### Tic Tac Toe (in-class)
Write a simple tic tac toe game in Python.  It should allow two human players to play a game against each other.  After each move, it should display the current state of the board.  It should not allow a player to mark a box that is already occupied.  If you have time, make it check if a player has won after each move.


### Essay
Essay assignments are your opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge of some of the topics we will learn in this course.  Essays are between three and five paragraphs.  The final paragraph should include some reflection and personal observations on what you have learned about the topic.

Essays will be graded on whether or not they demonstrate an understanding of the topic.  For full credit, find the most important points of each topic and be sure to mention them in your essay.  Formatting and correctness of your English will not be considered unless they make your writing difficult to read or understand.

For each essay assignment, you can find the subtopics in the [Proficiencies](https://github.com/Rybec/Video-Game-Design/blob/master/Proficiencies.md) file.


### Pixel Perfect Collision Detection
This assignment is designed to assess your ability to learn on your own and your ability to implement complex algorithms of the kind commonly used in games.

For this assignment, you are expected to learn _what_ pixel perfect collision detection is, do some research to learn some strategies for doing it, and then use what you have learned to write a simple demo program demostrating pixel perfect collision detection.

This assignment generally demonstrates the Video Game Development: Algorithms proficiency.  If you implement it in a way that demostrates additional proficiencies, you must inform me and provide me with evidence to get credit for those.


### Procedural Dungeon Generation Demo
This assignment is designed to assess your ability to learn on your own and your ability to implement complex algorithms of the kind commonly used in games.

For this assignment you are expected to learn _what_ procedural dungeon generation is, do some research to learn some strategies for doing it, and then use what you have learned to write a simple demo program demonstrating procedural dungeon generation.

This assigment generally demonstrates the Video Game Development: Algorithms and Data Structures proficiencies.  If you implement it in a way that demostrates additional proficiencies, you must inform me and provide me with evidence to get credit for those.


### Simple Animation
This is your opportunity to gain some experience with animation.  You must find an art asset with multiple animation frames (no less than four frames) and write a simple program to animate it.  You should put some effort into adjusting the animation timing, to make the animation look smooth and realistic.


### Simple Audio Playback
This is your opportunity to gain some experience with sound and sound effects in video games.  Using Python and Pygame, write a program that plays back some sounds.  At least one sound should be a longer audio clip (maybe background music) that plays for at least ten seconds.  At least one sound should be a short clip (perhaps a sound effect) that plays at the same time as the longer clip.
