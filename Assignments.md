# Course Work
Assignments and projects will not be given letter grades.  Instead, they will be used to demonstrate proficiencies.  The final course grade will be calculated based on the proficiencies demonstrated.  See Proficiencies.md for more information on grading.


## Projects

### Progress Reports
A progress report should begin with a brief description of the game, if this has not been done in a previous report.  After that, it should reveal the current progress on the project.  Lastly it should include places where you have struggled your solutions.  If you are still struggling with something, this is also a good time to get feedback and suggestions from the rest of the class.  A progress report is generally shorter than 5 minutes.


### Tabletop Game
The tabletop game project represents your opportunity to prove that you understand and can apply the principles of basic game design.  The game should accommodate at least two players.  The average play time for one game should be 15 minutes or less.  You must be able to identify the core mechanic if your tabletop game, and you should have a printed copy of the rules that is clear and unambiguous.

This project will be graded in class.  Students will play test their games with other students in the class, while the professor or a TA will observe.  Games that take excessively long may not be able to be completed during the allotted time.  In this case, the game will only earn a grade appropriate for what was demonstrated during the time it was played.


### Video Game
The final project for this course is a video game.  This is your opportunity to show your ability to apply everything you have learned in this course.

The video game project must meet the following requirements:
- Be written in Python or C/C++
- Have some degree of animation
- Have some sound effects
- Have an element that is educational or which has a purpose greater than just entertainment

This project will be graded in class.  Students will present and demonstrate their games during the last two or three class periods of the semester.  The presentations will also include some reflection of challenges encounted during design and development as well as how those challenges were overcome.  The amount of time allotted for each game will depend on how many games need to be demonstrated as a consequence of how students choose to group up.


## Assignments
### Answer Value of Games Questions
The first subcategory in the knowledge proficiencies category asks two questions.  You may write your answers to these questions down and turn them in to get credit for this assignment.


### Tic Tac Toe (in-class)
Write a simple tic tac toe game in Python.  It should allow two human players to play a game against each other.  After each move, it should display the current state of the board.  It should not allow a player to mark a box that it already occupied.  If you have time, make it check if a player has won after each move.


### Essay
Essay assignments are your opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge of some of the topics we will learn in this course.  Essays are between three and five paragraphs.  The final paragraph should include some reflection and personal observations on what you have learned about the topic.

Essays will be graded on whether or not they demonstrate an understanding of the topic.  Formatting and correctness of your English will not be considered unless they make your writing difficult to read or understand.


### Pixel Perfect Collision Detection
This assignment is designed to assess your ability to learn on your own and you ability to implement complex algorithms of the kind commonly used in games.

For this assignment, you are expected to learn _what_ pixel perfect collision detection is, do some research to learn some strategies for doing it, and then use what you have learned to write a simple demo program demostrating pixel perfect collision detection.


### Procedural Dungeon Generation Demo
This assignment is designed to assess your ability to learn on your own and you ability to implement complex algorithms of the kind commonly used in games.

For this assignment you are expected to learn _what_ procedural dungeon generation is, do some research to learn some strategies for doing it, and then use what you have learned to write a simple demo program demonstrating procedural dungeon generation.


### Simple Animation
This is your opportunity to gain some experience with animation.  You must find an art asset with multiple animation frames (no less than four frames) and write a simple program to animate it.  You should put some effort into adjusting the animation timing, to make the animation look smooth and realistic.


### Simple Audio Playback
This is you opportunity to gain some experience with sound and sound effects in video games.  Using Python and Pygame, write a program that plays back some sounds.  At least one sound should be a longer audio clip (maybe background music) that plays for at least ten seconds.  At least one sound should be a short clip (perhaps a sound effect) that plays at the same time as the longer clip.
