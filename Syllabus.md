## Requirements
- Regular class attendance is essential, as one of the objectives of this course is collaboration with other students taking the class.
- Meaningful research for discussions and essays is an important part of being self motivated to learn and understand the subject matter.
- Completing the reading assignments is essential to your ability to demonstrate proficiency in the various topics we will learn this semester.
- The projects are absolutely essential, as they represent your opportunity to demonstrate that you understand the principles taught well enough to apply them.

## Equipment
- BYU-Idaho requires all students to possess a laptop computer.  In-class activities are a significant part of this class, and these activities will require you to use your laptop in class.

## Grading
Grading is mostly covered in Proficiencies.md.  This course is graded using a proficiency model outlined in that document.  There are 10 core proficiencies which are each worth 10% of the grade.  Students are expected to demonstrate those proficiencies primarily through their course work.

The two projects are mandatory for a passing grade.  If a student fails to meet the requirements of either project, that student will fail the course, regardless of anything else.

Attendance is not graded, however it is both a critical part of the class and an important factor in accreditation of the college.  As such, a student that misses more than five classes (18.5% of the total number of class periods in the semester) will fail.

## Collaboration
Collaboration is important in most kinds of creative work.  It is especially important in video game design.  Collaboration will not be graded directly, however it is highly encouraged, and there will be certain times during classes where a degree of collaboration will be required.

Students are not required to work in groups, however it is highly recommended to work in groups of three or four.  It is very rare in the software industry to work completely solo, so please take advantage of this opportunity to prepare yourself to work with others.

While collaboration is not graded directly, note that students who choose not to collaborate tend to perform poorly in this course compared to those who do collaborate.


## Campus Policies
As a student of BYU-Idaho, it is your responsibility to know and follow all campus policies.  Please remember that you signed a legal contract and made a verbal promise to your ecclesiastical leader to follow the Honor Code and Church Standards, including obeying the law of the land, as a condition of attending this school.  I would appreciate it if you would learn your responsibilities and keep this promise, so that I do not have to report you to the Honor Office or the authorities.
